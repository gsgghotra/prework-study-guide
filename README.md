# Pre-work study Guide (Bootcamp)

## Description

Driven by my commitment to excel in an upcoming bootcamp, I developed the Bootcamp Note-Taking Guide. This practical platform not only assists me in combatting information overload, a common challenge during intensive learning programs but also provides a structured approach to capturing and organising my learning journey. Throughout its creation, I acquired fundamental skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git version control, enhancing my technical knowledge and equipping me with valuable collaboration tools as I prepare for my bootcamp journey.
